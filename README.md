A SIMPLE ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME

This project is a simple rock-paper-scissors game that runs on the console.
It was built using just html and javascript. it is my first javascript project.

The game starts by showing a prompt that accepts either rock,
paper, or scissors ONLY which you have to type in the field provided. The computer also selects either rock, paper, or scissors randomly.

The value selected by the player and computer are displayed and compared, and the score is updated after each round of the game. 

A total of 5 rounds are to be played, and at the end of the final round, the winner is announced based on the scores.
