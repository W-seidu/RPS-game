A SIMPLE ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME

This project is a simple rock-paper-scissors game that runs on the WEB.
It was initially built with html, and JavaScript to run on the web console. But it now 
runs on the webpage through the additional aid of css, and the JavaScript Document 
Object Model.

The game starts by showing a webpage with three buttons showing rock, paper, and 
scissors respectively for you to click on one. The computer also selects either rock, 
paper, or scissors randomly.

The value selected by the player and computer are displayed and compared, and the score is 
updated after each round of the game. The game also implements different color values to demonstrate 
who wins the round, or if the round is a tie. 

A total of 10 rounds are to be played, and at the end of the final round, the winner is announced based on the scores. 
After the game, a link is displayed for you to play again.
